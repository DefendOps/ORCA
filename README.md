- **Cloud Provider Support**: Seamlessly integrates with major cloud providers like AWS and DigitalOcean for flexible fleet deployment.
- **Agent Customization**: Configure each agent to probe specific targets, run tailored scans, and perform vulnerability assessments.
- **Background Services**: Run ORCA in the background to continuously scan your attack surface, receiving real-time updates.
